# Client-Server-Chat

A server is required to be started, after which, any number of clients connected can either send personal message, broadcast message or multicast messages to other clients using their username.
Clients can also send files to each other, which will be stored at the server and then forwarded to the destined person.

How To Run :

1) Execute server.class with syntax
	“java server”
It will automatically run the server on port 8000 of localhost

2)To connect clients to the server, execute the command
	“java client”

3)At start, the client will ask for a username, enter any “one word” as a username, if some other user had not taken that username, it will be allotted to you.

4)Send the messages or files as per the syntax shown after successful registration.
